A simple tox to save/load snapshots with all parameters of components inside a container

This is still a beta version, please report me any issue or improvement ideas.
It saves/loads all the parameters, custom parameters and panel values of the comps.
So you can modify, save and recall any setup.
I just created it to use for update many different installations with same patch, but different local settings.

How to use it:
1) import the tox inside the container/base you want to snap
2) insert a file name to save parameters in the "salvaPar" fileName parameter
3) use "save" and "load" buttons or pulses.
